        Welcome to use Manjusaka 4! This demo will show you how this system
        works. By now you should see a password prompt. Type either `b163cbf2`
        or `0b25ae28` (only the alphanumeric characters) in the box.

    - depends:
        - password=2
      message: |
        This is the message if one have entered `0b25ae28` as password above.
        If I send this code only to my colleagues, then they will now be able
        to read this message. Although this Manjusaka file contains more
        messages, they are unable to continue since no more questions to those
        messages are unlocked.

        Try refresh the page and enter the other code as password above.

        I intend to send the code `b163cbf2` to my relatives. If this is the
        only code they will know, then I may leave a message here for them.
        As you see, there should be more questions prompted now. These are
        previously hidden (encrypted) questions. Only when someone has read
        this message will they continue.
